This example shows how to create and delete a virtual cluster for testing an application named `my-app` on pull requests.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/vclusters.yaml
name: Pull Request Checks
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - "main"
  
env:
  VCLUSTER_NAME: pr-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}-${{ github.sha }}-${{ github.run_id }}

jobs:
  e2e:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Install vCluster CLI
        uses: loft-sh/setup-vcluster@main         
        with:
          url: ${{ secrets.VCLUSTER_PLATFORM_URL }}
          # Specify your vCluster Platform access key here
          access-key: ${{ secrets.VCLUSTER_PLATFORM_ACCESS_KEY }}
      - name: Create PR Virtual Cluster
        run: vcluster platform create vcluster $VCLUSTER_NAME --project default
      - name: Deploy Application
        run: kubectl apply -Rf ./kubernetes
      - name: Wait for Deployment
        run: kubectl rollout status deployments/my-app
      - name: Run Tests
        run: make e2e
      - name: Delete PR Virtual Cluster
        run: vcluster platform delete vcluster $VCLUSTER_NAME --project default
```

**Explanation:**

1. The [Setup vCluster Platform](https://github.com/loft-sh/setup-vcluster) action is used to install the vCluster CLI and log in to the organization's vCluster Platform instance. Environment variables `VCLUSTER_PLATFORM_URL` and `VCLUSTER_PLATFORM_ACCESS_KEY` are populated using [GitHub secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions).
2. The `vcluster platform create vcluster` command is used to create a unique virtual cluster using information about the pull request in the `default` project. This will automatically configure the kube context for the next steps.
3. The next step deploys the application using the runner provided `kubectl` and manifests located under `./kubernetes`.
4. Before running tests, we use `kubectl` to wait for the `my-app` deployment to become ready.
5. Now we run the end-to-end tests. In this example we're using `make` to run tests, but the command should be customized for your testing framework.
6. Finally, the `vcluster platform delete vcluster` command is used to delete the virtual cluster.
